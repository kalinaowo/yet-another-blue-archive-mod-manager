its yet another blue archive mod manager

 - Creates basic mod loading system
 - Backs up / Load original bundles 
 - Automatically patches CRC using the actual game's bundle file
Issues:
 - If mods are applied after they have been applied already, CRC may applied more then once.
Goals:
 - Automatically patches file name
 - Maybe automatically updates mods if they break
 - Detect old mods that use an outdated spine version (this probably cannot be fixed however)
 - Add support for sounds/video assets
 - ADD A GUI
